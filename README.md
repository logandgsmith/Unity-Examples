# Unity-Examples
Example Unity Scripts -- More generic than my other repository of scripts for class.

## Actor.cs
This is a barebones implementation of a finite state machine for actor behavior in Unity. Barebones in this case means the actor only has a single state, however, using the ExampleClass state, you should be able to easily modify and extend this example for your project.
